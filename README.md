# MERN-Full-Stack-App

A gym management system where users can track their progress on their lifts by adding in entries into a log. The user can store the name of the exercise, sets x rep, and weight. The date will be logged to know which days you trained what! 

This application was created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
